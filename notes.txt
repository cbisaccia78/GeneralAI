4 main components of learning agents



1. Critic
    observes the world and tells the learning element how well agent is doing with respect to fixed performance standard

2. Learning Element
    Uses feedback from the critic on how the agent is doing to determine how performance element should be
    modified to do better in future.
    Design depends very much on the design of the performance element.

3. Problem Generator
    Suggests actions that could lead to new and informative experiences

4. Performance Element
    Takes in percepts and decides on actions.



Evaluating Search algorithms:

should be evaluated based on:

completeness - guaranteed to find a solution if one exists?
optimality - guaranteed that solution has lowest path cost?
time complexity - how long does it take to find solution? T(b,d,m) = # nodes generated during search
space complexity - how much memory is needed to perform the search?  S(b,d,m) = maximum # of nodes stored in memory during search

complexity is considered with respect to the difficulty measure of the problem

difficulty measure of the problem is expressed in terms of three quantities:
    b - the branching factor or maximum number of successors of any node;
    d - the depth of the shallowest goal node (i.e., the number of steps along the path from the root);
    m - the maximum length of any path in the state space
